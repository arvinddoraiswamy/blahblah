- Unlock door is back. At 444a. Need to overwrite ret with 4a44 then.
- Asks for username and password.
- Need to overwrite 4440 with 444a. That should unlock the door.
- Looks like some stop_progexecs inbetween. Need to somehow be able to jump over them.
- 2404 to 246f zeroed out. Probably to store the username and the password.
- Prints out the entered username. Copies to 43a2.
- Prints out the entered password. Copies to 43b5.
- 45e2. Length of password in r11.
- Password <= 10 is a must else program will exit.
- Password >8 though is a must else program will exit.
- This means it is a 9 char password. :). Well mostly :).
- 9 char password for sure but how do we make sure it is a 9 char password and yet overwrite ret?
- 43aa has the flag for INT 7d but that's useless as we don't know the password.

Random thoughts:
- Send a 9 char password and a super long username.
- The username though must have a null char such that the password condition matches perfectly.
- Payload works and I can bypass the length check but ret isn't getting overwritten :(
- Test at 464c means I cant have a null char inbetween. Not that it matters as it it doesn't overwrite 4440 anyway.
- Cant overwrite the flag either for sure, it starts before the username starts.

Woo hoo finally. It was all playing with the bytes.
