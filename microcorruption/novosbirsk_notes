- Another format string vulnerability
- Need to enter username. Max limit is fe0a - that's 65534 characters - the max supported by the controller
- strcpy too so no null characters in there
- Could try and overwrite return address after strcpy (a) - So strcpy overwrites only till 43f0...doesn't write in the actual code section. Must ask why.
- printf so format string attacks possible again (b)
- conditional_unlock_door which uses 7e - need to make that 7f somehow (c)
- Normal flow goes to conditional_unlock_door so all we need to do is to make 7e 7f and we're good
- You don't need the damn %x - it's all addresses :-o :-o
- Wrote 127 bytes and overwrote INT 7e with INT 7f. Done :)
