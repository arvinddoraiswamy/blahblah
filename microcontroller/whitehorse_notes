- No unlock door, must find some new location to jump to
- Replaced by conditional_unlock_door at 4446
- main() - login() - getsn() takes password - unconditional_jump()
- entered password at 33f4
- 33ee flushed to 0. Looks like cusco and johannesburg so far.
- INT 7e. No unlock door as 7e triggers unlock door automatically. So as long as I can set 33ee to a non zero number I'm good.
- 1c45 goes to access granted and 33ee is also 0a but er.. door doesn't unlock :( [414243444546474849505152535455561c45]
- called conditional_unlock but reg values are all zero so that's a fail again :(
- calling int 7e directly with stack arguments as before also fails - probably obviously since the password is wrong
- calling 7f directly to see if that'll trigger an unlock directly (WooHooWooHoo :) :))
