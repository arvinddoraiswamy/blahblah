- Heh. 20 points? Shd be easy. Maybe ;)
- Are you using all the functionality your debugger gives you?
    - Toggle minimal mode
    - track, untrack registers
    - read the help
- Don't keep thinking of classic buffer overflows and sending large strings. Sometimes you can do stuff even with short strings.
- Again, old question, what inputs, how long, where do they go, what part of the program deals with which? How?
- Are specific bits of your input used anywhere?
