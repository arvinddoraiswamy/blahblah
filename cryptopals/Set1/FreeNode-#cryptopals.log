Apr 28 11:57:40 <Rami`>	sup
Apr 28 11:57:44 <Rami`>	for another 30 mins or so
Apr 28 11:57:50 <lde>	hey
Apr 28 11:58:02 <lde>	so...challenge 6
Apr 28 11:58:03 <lde>	set 1
Apr 28 11:58:10 <lde>	i had a couple of quests
Apr 28 11:59:18 <lde>	with 1 sample per keylength i get a different hamming distance
Apr 28 11:59:35 <lde>	but there are statements which say to "average" things out
Apr 28 11:59:45 <Rami`>	right
Apr 28 11:59:50 *	Rami` goes to look at challenge desc
Apr 28 12:00:06 <lde>	so i took 4 samples per keylength
Apr 28 12:00:24 <Rami`>	aha
Apr 28 12:00:26 <lde>	and get say 4 hamming distances 
Apr 28 12:00:31 <lde>	and div/4
Apr 28 12:00:38 <lde>	is that logic even right?
Apr 28 12:01:18 <Rami`>	just finding my function for it
Apr 28 12:01:42 <lde>	k..
Apr 28 12:01:43 <Rami`>	you basically want a function to derive the key_size
Apr 28 12:02:02 <lde>	can I pm you a link to my code?
Apr 28 12:02:22 <Rami`>	sure
Apr 28 12:03:50 <lde>	done, just probably quicker than me trying to describe what i did
Apr 28 12:03:52 <lde>	:)
Apr 28 12:04:33 <Rami`>	right
Apr 28 12:04:35 <Rami`>	lets have a peek
Apr 28 12:04:45 <lde>	thx
Apr 28 12:05:22 <kjn>	i seem to remember with that challenge needing to take more averages than they suggest and looking at more key candidates than they suggest
Apr 28 12:05:30 <kjn>	though it's been a while since i've done it
Apr 28 12:05:45 <Rami`>	right, so you;re on the right track
Apr 28 12:06:22 <Rami`>	you're taking your buffer, then for each candidate key size
Apr 28 12:06:30 <Rami`>	rightly limited from 2 to 48
Apr 28 12:06:36 <Rami`>	you  want to take a set of samples
Apr 28 12:07:08 <lde>	kjn: thanks. Yeah, I am very poor at crypto, so prolly need help as I go along :)
Apr 28 12:07:23 <Rami`>	that means if you're taking X samples, you take X slices of keysize-sized chunks from your buffer
Apr 28 12:07:29 <lde>	correct
Apr 28 12:07:53 <Rami`>	you're taking 2 at a minimum since you seem to be doing +1
Apr 28 12:07:58 <lde>	correct
Apr 28 12:08:01 <Rami`>	let me tell you, you want at least 6 samples
Apr 28 12:08:03 <Rami`>	now
Apr 28 12:08:09 <lde>	ah okay, that's easily fixed
Apr 28 12:08:14 <Rami`>	when you compare samples and get hamming distance
Apr 28 12:08:16 <Rami`>	you are doing this
Apr 28 12:08:16 <lde>	rt
Apr 28 12:09:10 <Rami`>	for sample set [A, B, C], you do: hamming (A, B), hamming (B, C)
Apr 28 12:09:12 <Rami`>	stop
Apr 28 12:09:17 <lde>	rt
Apr 28 12:09:24 <Rami`>	so you get 2 hammings for a set of 3, 1 hamming for a set of 2
Apr 28 12:09:29 <Rami`>	i.e. n-1 hamming scores
Apr 28 12:09:29 <lde>	correct
Apr 28 12:09:39 <Rami`>	you don't want permutations
Apr 28 12:09:41 <Rami`>	you want combinations
Apr 28 12:09:59 <Rami`>	for A, B, C you want: hamming(A, B), hamming(A, C), hamming(B, C)
Apr 28 12:10:08 <lde>	okay got it, will fix that
Apr 28 12:10:36 <Rami`>	just sum the hamming scores, then take average (so divide by number of measurements you took)
Apr 28 12:10:59 <Rami`>	then just keep track of your lowest outcome
Apr 28 12:10:59 <lde>	right, i was doing that - wasnt sure if the logic was rt
Apr 28 12:11:01 <Rami`>	and that's your winner
Apr 28 12:11:06 <lde>	just with 4 samples
Apr 28 12:11:19 <Rami`>	yeah, even 6 samples with permutations
Apr 28 12:11:22 <Rami`>	isn't good enough
Apr 28 12:11:25 <Rami`>	you need 6 and combinations
Apr 28 12:11:39 <Rami`>	it's the combination requirement people get hung up on
Apr 28 12:11:45 <lde>	when i took top 5 then iirc i got keylen - [2,529,10,31] or something
Apr 28 12:11:54 <lde>	sorry [2,5,29,10,31]
Apr 28 12:12:21 <lde>	whats the logic of the *combinations* though? why do we do it?
Apr 28 12:13:02 <Rami`>	well you want to test each sample against ALL the other samples right
Apr 28 12:13:09 <Rami`>	the samples are independent for our purposes
Apr 28 12:13:15 <kjn>	i didn't do combinations in my solution
Apr 28 12:13:24 <Rami`>	then you probably needed a lot more samples?
Apr 28 12:14:10 <Rami`>	for samples A, B, C and D, comparing A to B is just as valid as comparing A to D, so you should do all of them
Apr 28 12:14:13 <kjn>	for each key length, i took the average of 4 edit distances
Apr 28 12:14:26 <lde>	okay will do
Apr 28 12:14:32 <Rami`>	well the exercise might be simple enough to still get the answer
Apr 28 12:14:37 <kjn>	then i attempted to crack the ciphertext using the 5 shortest averages
Apr 28 12:14:42 <Rami`>	I was under the impression that it gave the wrong answer
Apr 28 12:14:44 <Rami`>	ah
Apr 28 12:15:21 <Rami`>	well this test is small enough to still catch it but with combination approach you can nail the right key length every time
Apr 28 12:15:22 <kjn>	well, more accurately, whatever key lengths resulted in the 5 shortest averages
Apr 28 12:15:46 <lde>	so is it always...more samples --> better accuracy?
Apr 28 12:15:57 <Rami`>	yes
Apr 28 12:16:19 <kjn>	well, it seems to be. i don't know if that's a proven thing though
Apr 28 12:16:27 <lde>	k..
Apr 28 12:16:36 <kjn>	and i don't know what the magic number of samples is either
Apr 28 12:17:03 <kjn>	i remeber playing around with it for a while and the correct key length won't always be in the top 5, even as you consider more samples
Apr 28 12:17:34 <kjn>	but since it was just an exercise, i stopped when i got the right answer :)
Apr 28 12:18:00 <lde>	couple more quests though.. whats the logic of sort by *smallest* hamming? Is it because the smaller the hamming, the more it is likely you have the rt keylength?
Apr 28 12:19:46 <kjn>	well, the challenge specifically says that. as for the reasoning, it doesn't explain why
Apr 28 12:20:11 <lde>	right, i just wondered why that's all (cryptographically i mean)
Apr 28 12:20:27 <kjn>	i assume it has something to do with the interplay between letter frequencies and word boundaries
Apr 28 12:20:56 <lde>	okay
Apr 28 12:21:02 <kjn>	and how that lines up with your block size
Apr 28 12:21:12 <kjn>	but don't quote me on that :)
Apr 28 12:21:15 <lde>	:)
Apr 28 12:21:50 <lde>	the only other quest i had was on the last step...what's a histogram they talk about? Is it just... do the ETAION thing on the result of every XOR?
Apr 28 12:22:10 <lde>	frequency analysis i mean
Apr 28 12:22:15 <lde>	of letters
Apr 28 12:22:25 <kjn>	so in challenge 3, you're suppose to devise a method to automatically determine if you have plaintext
Apr 28 12:22:36 <lde>	yep have that code
Apr 28 12:23:14 <kjn>	so you need to use that in challenge 6
Apr 28 12:23:34 <kjn>	remember, you're going to be trying multiple keys, so you need a way to determine which one is right
Apr 28 12:23:50 <lde>	yep, all good so far
Apr 28 12:24:02 <kjn>	so that's all they're referring to by "histogram"
Apr 28 12:24:08 <lde>	hmm intersting
Apr 28 12:24:22 <lde>	i got large bunches of "unreadable" ascii throughout
Apr 28 12:24:31 <lde>	like no proper english anywhere
Apr 28 12:24:50 <lde>	which got me thinking if i had misinterpreted
Apr 28 12:25:02 <kjn>	yeah. that would mean you didn't crack the ciphertext :)
Apr 28 12:25:13 <lde>	lol thats what i feared :)
Apr 28 12:25:51 <lde>	okay let me go back and try
Apr 28 12:26:16 <Rami`>	re: smallest
Apr 28 12:29:09 <Rami`>	english language is a subset of the total ASCII range
Apr 28 12:29:19 <kjn>	reading back ... yead, lde. by histogram, they just mean the frequency analysis you presumably came up with for challenge 3
Apr 28 12:29:27 <Rami`>	so statistically speaking hamming distances between 2 chunks of english (even encrypted)
Apr 28 12:29:31 <Rami`>	will be closer together
Apr 28 12:29:36 <Rami`>	than two random strings of gibberish
Apr 28 12:30:03 <Rami`>	since random gibberish will include bytes that are way outside of the ascii range
Apr 28 12:30:12 <Rami`>	so the hamming distance on those will be much higher
Apr 28 12:30:34 <Rami`>	of course, you might just randomly get 2 high bytes to compare and their hamming distance is low
Apr 28 12:30:36 <lde>	kjn: thanks
Apr 28 12:30:38 <Rami`>	but that's why you take a LOT of samples
Apr 28 12:30:46 <Rami`>	to remove that noise
Apr 28 12:31:08 <lde>	ah okay got it now
Apr 28 12:31:19 <lde>	so its because of *English*
Apr 28 12:31:33 <Rami`>	well any language really
Apr 28 12:31:44 <Rami`>	our alphabet only has 26 letters
Apr 28 12:31:46 <lde>	correct
Apr 28 12:31:52 <Rami`>	and our byte values can be 0-255
Apr 28 12:31:55 <Rami`>	so..
Apr 28 12:32:49 <lde>	cool got it, thanks
Apr 28 12:33:03 <lde>	i'll go try this again
Apr 28 12:35:20 <kjn>	i should start poking around with these again. i only got through the first two sets
Apr 28 12:37:12 <lde>	kjn: gl
Apr 28 12:37:44 <lde>	and are the links to solutions broken on the site? they never seem to work for me
Apr 28 12:38:01 <kjn>	if you get through the second set, you'll understand exactly how the POODLE attack on SSL worked
Apr 28 12:38:10 <kjn>	yup
Apr 28 12:38:39 <kjn>	you can find people's solutions though, if your persistent enough with the googles
Apr 28 12:38:49 <kjn>	*you're
Apr 28 12:38:51 <lde>	ooh nice...i hope to get through this one quick, stuck on it for ages lol
Apr 28 12:38:54 <Rami`>	afk here
Apr 28 12:39:00 <lde>	thnx Rami`
Apr 28 12:39:10 <Rami`>	don't peek at solutions ;) ask pointers and we'll try our best
Apr 28 12:39:15 <lde>	:)
Apr 28 12:39:28 <lde>	i tried to look once... but it confused me more - so i came here
Apr 28 12:39:30 <lde>	:)
Apr 28 12:39:39 <lde>	and this is much much nicer
Apr 28 12:39:46 <kjn>	yeah, i only did that to try and make sure i understood what the question is asking
Apr 28 12:40:01 <kjn>	once i found this channel, you really don't need to look for solutions anymore
Apr 28 12:40:05 <lde>	right, this prob for eg..steps 3 and 4 are super confusing
Apr 28 12:40:05 <kjn>	at least imo
Apr 28 12:40:07 <kjn>	:)
Apr 28 12:40:08 <lde>	i agree
Apr 28 12:41:30 <lde>	i would say the 2nd part of Step 4 for this, should really be part of Step 3
Apr 28 12:41:36 <lde>	that's what threw me off the most
Apr 28 12:42:36 <kjn>	yeah, i remember thinking challenge 6 could have been worded a little better
Apr 28 12:43:15 <kjn>	i got stuck for a while simply because i wasn't looking at enough keys or considering enough edit distances
Apr 28 12:43:24 <kjn>	but i was otherwise on the right track
Apr 28 12:43:50 <lde>	thats cool

Apr 28 12:44:15 <kjn>	i didn't know that though until i found somebody else's solution and saw that that's what they were doing

Apr 28 12:44:23 <Rami`>	now I'm really off, train to catch lol
Apr 28 12:44:26 <lde>	lol
Apr 28 12:44:29 <lde>	cya :)
Apr 28 12:44:59 <lde>	i mean, in the end - imo - as long as u know you're honestly learning, its fine, whatever path you choose
Apr 28 12:45:13 <kjn>	well, that was before i found this channel, like i said
Apr 28 12:45:20 <lde>	true
Apr 28 12:45:23 <kjn>	i would've just asked in here
Apr 28 12:46:04 <lde>	yeah nicer
Apr 28 12:47:58 <kjn>	like, i didn't think challenge 14 was very clear either. i came in here for that one though

Apr 28 13:02:38 <SomeKittens>	Yeah, needed help with #14
Apr 28 13:02:50 <SomeKittens>	turns out it was the *same* random prefix every time
Apr 28 13:03:59 <kjn>	yup, that's exactly what tripped me up
Apr 28 13:04:06 <kjn>	makes the problem SIGNIFICANTLY easier
Apr 28 13:23:59 *	jjarmoc has quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
Apr 28 13:25:45 <SomeKittens>	which is kind of the point of cryptopals
Apr 28 13:26:03 <SomeKittens>	this isn't something where you can just follow the instructions *really well* and win
Apr 28 13:33:08 <lde>	on a tangent though, all these crypto attacks that keep happening, like BEAST and CRIME and POODLE and whatever tomorrow.... have there really been anyone actually using them to exploit stuff?
Apr 28 13:34:03 <lde>	sure , we should fix and all that (which is what I tell my clients too), but does anyone really exploit them in the wild?
Apr 28 13:55:14 <SomeKittens>	lde: yes, very yes
Apr 28 13:55:31 <SomeKittens>	mostly botnets picking up more members
Apr 28 13:57:02 <lde>	cool thnx
Apr 28 13:58:10 <lde>	just seems that there'd be so many easier ways to screw someone/some company than say, a downgrade SSL attack which is significantly more complex
Apr 28 13:58:14 <lde>	that was my thought
Apr 28 14:25:32 <SomeKittens>	once you've implemented it, you can stick it in a for loop
Apr 28 14:28:40 <lde>	true
Apr 28 14:36:05 <kjn>	Heartbleed, which people at first didn't think could be practically exploited, was used to compromise some VPN keys and hack into the network of a health insurance company
Apr 28 14:36:26 <kjn>	some 4.5 million people's records were compromised
Apr 28 14:41:39 <lde>	kjn: true. I'm not questioning it cant be done at all. More that, attacking *via* crypto seems more difficult than stealing off a sticky pad
Apr 28 14:41:45 <lde>	hence the thought

Apr 28 16:04:43 <cpach>	nice to see some activity here :)
Apr 28 16:17:41 <bnagy>	SomeKittens: 14 is doable with random length new prefix on every call to the oracle
Apr 28 16:18:43 <bnagy>	I just did it that way and only realised way later ( people often ask about that here ) that there was another way to read it :(
Apr 28 16:19:38 <SomeKittens>	bnagy: Yeah, I spent a while on that before finding out the other way
Apr 28 16:19:54 <SomeKittens>	though I doubt Matasano will touch it
Apr 28 16:20:04 <bnagy>	eh?
Apr 28 16:20:18 <bnagy>	don't you need to deal with variable lengths in the same set?
Apr 28 16:20:39 <SomeKittens>	I spent a while on the always-new random prefix
Apr 28 16:20:54 <sheilong>	What kind of math is needed to do the challenges ?
Apr 28 16:21:04 <bnagy>	sheilong: high school
Apr 28 16:21:24 <bnagy>	early high school, tbh
Apr 28 16:21:45 <bnagy>	SomeKittens: the random length new prefix approach is just a trick, it's not "hard" at all
Apr 28 16:22:03 <bnagy>	just a 'once you see it' thing
Apr 28 16:22:09 *	SomeKittens is not good at those
Apr 28 16:22:32 <bnagy>	now that I am looking, maybe they _didn't_ make you deal with random lengths afterwards o_0
Apr 28 16:22:36 *	bnagy flips through solutions
Apr 28 16:24:13 <sheilong>	bnagy:  Cool, thanks for answer
Apr 28 16:26:12 <bnagy>	some of the stuff you are working in finite fields but you don't need to know that
Apr 28 16:26:35 <bnagy>	basic algebra and how knowing how modulus works should be enough
Apr 28 16:27:04 <bnagy>	and reading notation right at the very very end
Apr 28 16:30:12 <sheilong>	scientific notation you mean ?
Apr 28 16:30:23 <bnagy>	mathematical notation
Apr 28 16:30:43 <bnagy>	squiggly greek letters and such
Apr 28 16:31:01 <bnagy>	but only to read one paper
Apr 28 16:32:27 <jjarmoc>	that’s pretty far in.. if you make it that far you’re well ahead of the curve
Apr 28 16:33:26 <sheilong>	ok
Apr 28 16:35:23 <SomeKittens>	jjarmoc: any idea what the curve looks like?
Apr 28 16:35:36 <jjarmoc>	I knew someone was going to ask that...
Apr 28 16:35:53 <jjarmoc>	I don’t have the actual data, and now that it’s not tracked via email, there really is no new data coming it
Apr 28 16:35:56 <jjarmoc>	s/it/in/
Apr 28 16:36:22 <bnagy>	when I finished I think there were <30 finished and thousands of starts
Apr 28 16:36:30 <jjarmoc>	but anecdotally, I think there was a large number of people who did set 1, and a pretty decent drop off around 5-6…
Apr 28 16:36:38 <jjarmoc>	that sounds about right
Apr 28 16:36:46 <bnagy>	but the taper from 1-3 was brutal
Apr 28 16:37:06 <bnagy>	6 tapered again from like couple hundred to not-many
Apr 28 16:37:08 <jjarmoc>	yah, the early levels lose a lot of folks who are just curious, but turn out to not want to spend time on it
Apr 28 16:38:03 <jjarmoc>	Honestly, I haven’t completed the last sets :)
Apr 28 16:38:17 <bnagy>	I am still waiting for the EC set
Apr 28 16:38:42 <bnagy>	tqbf sent me a message about whom to annoy but then I got busy with a project
Apr 28 16:39:02 <jjarmoc>	last I heard, that was still being worked on...
Apr 28 16:39:17 <jjarmoc>	the Crypto services guys have been a little busy lately
Apr 28 16:39:25 <jjarmoc>	Truecrypt, OpenSSL, Blackhat training, etc…
Apr 28 16:39:31 <bnagy>	intolerable
Apr 28 16:39:34 <jjarmoc>	lol
Apr 28 16:40:32 <bnagy>	how many in that group now?

Apr 28 23:05:59 <SomeKittens>	Alright, hacking on #16
Apr 28 23:06:06 <SomeKittens>	time for some rubber ducking
Apr 28 23:06:42 <SomeKittens>	so I'm xoring 'admin=true;aaaaa' and 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' to get what I need to stick into the ciphertext
Apr 28 23:07:40 <SomeKittens>	but it's coming out as 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa', not  'admin=true;aaaaa'
Apr 28 23:10:29 <SomeKittens>	https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/593250595340886016
Apr 28 23:10:35 <SomeKittens>	whoops, wrong channel
Apr 28 23:11:06 <SomeKittens>	What *should* be happening (to my knowledge):
Apr 28 23:11:44 <SomeKittens>	I corrupt chunk A with data that when XOR'd with the plaintext in chunk B, results in admin=true
Apr 28 23:12:21 <SomeKittens>	so I should get gibberish for decrypted chunk A
Apr 28 23:13:55 <SomeKittens>	but decrypted chunk B, when XOR'd with chunk A's ciphertext, should result in the admin=true payload.
Apr 28 23:28:13 <kjn>	i'm not sure about a couple of your statements there, so let's just walk through this
Apr 28 23:28:17 <kjn>	here's what CBC is doing:
Apr 28 23:28:31 <kjn>	block A ciphertext XOR block B plaintext = block B'. Block B' is then encrypted to get block B ciphertext
Apr 28 23:28:56 <kjn>	so in reverse: block B' XOR block A ciphertext = block B plaintext
Apr 28 23:29:29 <kjn>	with me?
Apr 28 23:29:58 <kjn>	SomeKittens: with me?
Apr 28 23:30:37 <SomeKittens>	yeah
Apr 28 23:31:53 <kjn>	ok. so you don't know block B', but you can recreate it
Apr 28 23:32:09 <kjn>	see how?
Apr 28 23:33:54 <kjn>	once you have that, then you can create any block A "ciphertext" to get any block B plaintext of your choosing
Apr 28 23:35:13 <SomeKittens>	"But you can recreate it" <- not sure what you mean
Apr 28 23:37:11 <kjn>	remember, they have you write a function that accepts plaintext of your choosing, then you get ciphertext back
Apr 28 23:37:29 <kjn>	so you know the plaintext you put in, and you know the ciphertext you get out
Apr 28 23:37:50 <kjn>	and if you know any two elements of that equation, you can get the third
Apr 28 23:38:52 <kjn>	did that make it any clearer?
Apr 28 23:39:44 <SomeKittens>	That's where I thought I was
Apr 28 23:40:27 <SomeKittens>	sorry for my ineptitude - I'm not very good at this
Apr 28 23:41:05 <kjn>	No, this can be tricky
Apr 28 23:41:57 *	SomeKittens reviews the CBC diagram on Wikipedia
Apr 28 23:42:26 <SomeKittens>	kjn: no kidding, some of this stuff is really tricky.  And I'm only on #16!
Apr 28 23:42:35 <SomeKittens>	still waaaay better than "Hey, move this modal over there" of dayjob
Apr 28 23:43:19 <kjn>	Heh
Apr 28 23:44:18 <lde>	SomeKittens: cheer up, you're working at it as best you can :) - not that i'm very better frankly, probably worse
Apr 28 23:44:32 <SomeKittens>	lde: you'll probably catch up to me soon
Apr 28 23:44:41 <kjn>	I'm trying to think how better to explain it. :/
Apr 28 23:44:50 <kjn>	SomeKittens | "But you can recreate it" <- not sure what you mean
Apr 28 23:45:06 <kjn>	What are you confused about there?
Apr 28 23:47:42 <SomeKittens>	I don't know block B' (post XOR, but pre encryption).
Apr 28 23:48:04 <SomeKittens>	but I can recreate it via XORing the crypted data (which I have) and the plaintext (which I injected).
Apr 28 23:48:09 <SomeKittens>	welp, answered my own question.
Apr 28 23:48:16 <kjn>	yup, exactly
Apr 28 23:49:14 <kjn>	now you have Block B', and a malicious block B plaintext that you want
Apr 28 23:49:40 <kjn>	so now you can create a Block A "ciphertext" using that equation i gave you
Apr 28 23:49:53 <SomeKittens>	ah, ok
Apr 28 23:49:54 <kjn>	though as you say, Block A will end up being garbled when it's decrypted
Apr 28 23:51:23 <SomeKittens>	http://assets.amuniversal.com/4c6b3ee0df8f01317256005056a9545d <-- last panel is me right now
Apr 28 23:52:23 <kjn>	Heh. :-)
Apr 28 23:52:29 <kjn>	Calvin & Hobbes FTW!
Apr 28 23:56:12 <kjn>	the tricky thing about #16 is figuring out what to do. implementing it isn't too bad. at least imo
Apr 28 23:56:51 <SomeKittens>	implementing #14 was painful
Apr 28 23:57:02 <SomeKittens>	I was off-by-six once you counted up all the off-by-one errors
Apr 28 23:57:48 <kjn>	heh.
Apr 28 23:58:03 <kjn>	yeah, after #14, 15 and 16 were a welcome relief
Apr 28 23:58:22 <kjn>	of course it didn't help me that i first tackled #14 assuming it was random EVERY TIME. argh....
Apr 28 23:58:49 <SomeKittens>	seems like we all made that mistake
Apr 29 00:00:35 <kjn>	i actually got a somewhat working solution, but it would basically crash on me randomly
Apr 29 00:00:52 <kjn>	once i figured out what was causing that, i was like, "no way is this supposed to be that tough!"
Apr 29 00:00:59 <kjn>	luckily, that's right about the time i found this channel
Apr 29 00:01:55 <SomeKittens>	AHA
Apr 29 00:02:02 <kjn>	what's cool about #14 is that's basically how the POODLE attack works
Apr 29 00:02:06 <SomeKittens>	yep, figured out where my assumption went wrong
Apr 29 00:03:13 <SomeKittens>	I was treating decrypted, pre-XOR data as encrypted data
Apr 29 00:04:16 <kjn>	yeah, that's kind of the big conceptual block on that one
Apr 29 00:24:56 <SomeKittens>	ok, lost again
Apr 29 00:27:15 <kjn>	:(
Apr 29 00:27:37 <SomeKittens>	I can recreate block B', but what good does that do me?
Apr 29 00:28:44 <SomeKittens>	if I don't know the key
Apr 29 00:29:08 <kjn>	you don't need to know the key
Apr 29 00:29:23 <kjn>	remember: A ciphertext XOR B = B'
Apr 29 00:29:34 <kjn>	if you know any two, you can create the third
Apr 29 00:30:20 <bnagy>	SomeKittens: you have the right idea
Apr 29 00:30:35 <SomeKittens>	bnagy: Yeah.  I'm just having trouble putting everything in the right order
Apr 29 00:31:11 <bnagy>	remember that there are two parts to this problem, the setup and the reveal
Apr 29 00:31:44 <bnagy>	go through your game plan in plain english, starting as simply as you possibly can
Apr 29 00:31:47 <SomeKittens>	kjn: but don't I need B ciphertext?
Apr 29 00:32:13 <kjn>	no. that can't change
Apr 29 00:32:22 <kjn>	which means B' can't change
Apr 29 00:32:26 <bnagy>	uh
Apr 29 00:32:29 <SomeKittens>	bnagy: alright, lemme try
Apr 29 00:32:35 <bnagy>	this is 16, right?
Apr 29 00:32:56 <SomeKittens>	I need B plaintext to be admin=true or something like it
Apr 29 00:33:13 <bnagy>	what's B?
Apr 29 00:33:25 <SomeKittens>	(this is 16, yes)
Apr 29 00:33:28 <kjn>	just the blocks
Apr 29 00:33:32 <kjn>	block a, block b, etc.
Apr 29 00:33:34 <SomeKittens>	A and B are both blocks under my control
Apr 29 00:33:45 <kjn>	written another way:
Apr 29 00:33:52 <SomeKittens>	(specifically, I control the inputs, as well as the ciphertext)
Apr 29 00:33:54 <kjn>	B' XOR B = A ciphertext
Apr 29 00:33:58 <bnagy>	kjn: I actually know the answer
Apr 29 00:34:06 <kjn>	as do i, bnagy
Apr 29 00:34:10 <bnagy>	I'm being didactic (spoiler)
Apr 29 00:34:11 <SomeKittens>	bnagy: you've beaten the whole shebang, right?
Apr 29 00:34:16 <bnagy>	yes
Apr 29 00:34:43 <kjn>	i'm trying to as well. not that i'm succeeding. :)
Apr 29 00:34:45 <bnagy>	so your notation is [prefix][A][B][postfix] ?
Apr 29 00:35:07 <bnagy>	where you control A and B (as well as any other number of blocks you want)
Apr 29 00:35:32 <bnagy>	so carry on explaining your plan
Apr 29 00:36:56 <kjn>	trying to be didactic, that is :)
Apr 29 00:37:50 <SomeKittens>	(I teach at a bootcamp on the side, so I understand just how hard it is to give hints without giving away the answer, really appreciate it from both of you)
Apr 29 00:39:46 <bnagy>	kjn: btw you can (should imho ;) beat 14 with random prefix of random length each time
Apr 29 00:40:03 <SomeKittens>	So my plan was to XOR my attack text with the text I handed the encryptor and then replace block A with that
Apr 29 00:40:26 <bnagy>	SomeKittens: too techy, zoom out
Apr 29 00:40:30 <SomeKittens>	but that wouldn't work, as B' *isn't* the text I gave the encryptor
Apr 29 00:40:55 <SomeKittens>	bnagy: hmm
Apr 29 00:41:09 <kjn>	bnagy: i had a mostly working solution, but it would fail on a particular edge cases
Apr 29 00:41:18 <bnagy>	high level plan of attack, in two phases
Apr 29 00:41:30 <SomeKittens>	I can't touch block B (and therefore Block B', as kjn mentioned)
Apr 29 00:42:07 <bnagy>	ok in my notation B' is the ciphered version of B
Apr 29 00:42:20 <SomeKittens>	er
Apr 29 00:42:25 <bnagy>	you can touch it as much as you want
Apr 29 00:42:38 <SomeKittens>	I've been using B' to mean the decrypted, yet-to-be-XOR'd text
Apr 29 00:42:50 <SomeKittens>	So for the setup, I need to set A ciphertext to something that XOR's against B' to get the target text
Apr 29 00:43:29 <kjn>	we've been using B' to refer to B between being XORed with A ciphertext and being encrypted with the key
Apr 29 00:43:59 <bnagy>	ok
Apr 29 00:44:04 <bnagy>	let's try not doing that
Apr 29 00:44:24 <bnagy>	let's say A B and A' (A in the ciphertext) and B'
Apr 29 00:44:40 <bnagy>	so with that notation tell me what messing with A' does
Apr 29 00:45:15 <bnagy>	it's just shorter than C(A) or whatever of f(A)
Apr 29 00:45:19 <SomeKittens>	completely garbles the resulting A plaintext and flips the bits on B
Apr 29 00:45:33 <bnagy>	ok
Apr 29 00:46:12 <bnagy>	flips which bits in B?
Apr 29 00:46:26 <bnagy>	B meaning B plain, obvs
Apr 29 00:47:02 <SomeKittens>	the bits corresponding to wherever I introduced the "error"
Apr 29 00:47:23 <bnagy>	k
Apr 29 00:48:20 <bnagy>	now I am having trouble working out where you're stuck :)
Apr 29 00:49:29 <SomeKittens>	so if I take encrypted A, and XOR it against plaintext B, I get B', like kjn said.  Then I need to XOR my B' with my target text, and set it the resulting data to A cyphertext
Apr 29 00:49:36 <SomeKittens>	...that makes sense
Apr 29 00:49:40 *	SomeKittens scurries off to implement it
Apr 29 00:49:45 <bnagy>	why are you doing all that?
Apr 29 00:51:13 <bnagy>	ohh waitwait I see
Apr 29 00:51:27 <bnagy>	you're trying to construct some arcane B, aren't you
Apr 29 00:52:23 <SomeKittens>	WORKED
Apr 29 00:52:36 <SomeKittens>	Thank you so much to you both for sticking with my dull brain
Apr 29 00:52:41 <SomeKittens>	(it was a long day at work)
Apr 29 00:53:10 <bnagy>	you took the long way around :)
Apr 29 00:53:19 <bnagy>	I'll spoil you, now that you solved it
Apr 29 00:53:19 <SomeKittens>	hah, no kidding
Apr 29 00:53:32 <bnagy>	my B is AAAAA:admin<true
Apr 29 00:54:51 <SomeKittens>	bnagy: as opposed to?
Apr 29 00:55:04 <kjn>	i suppose you only need to munge the two bits that you want changed
Apr 29 00:55:08 <bnagy>	lots of stuff xored together
Apr 29 00:55:26 <bnagy>	^^ cause that, you only need to flip two bits
Apr 29 00:55:44 <bnagy>	your way is going to be more useful later though
Apr 29 00:55:51 <kjn>	':' XOR ';' = x
Apr 29 00:56:08 <kjn>	then change the appropriate bit in A ciphertext to x
Apr 29 00:56:34 <SomeKittens>	bnagy: oh, I thought the < was a typo
Apr 29 00:56:37 <SomeKittens>	but yes, that makes sense
Apr 29 00:57:34 <SomeKittens>	I guess I was trying to "brute force" it in a sense
Apr 29 00:57:41 <kjn>	i might've done that if i wasn't working in python 3, which has immutable byte strings
Apr 29 00:57:59 <kjn>	so i needed to regenerate the entire block anyway
Apr 29 00:58:01 <bnagy>	bwaaahahaha now you get padding oracle
Apr 29 00:58:05 <bnagy>	I LOVE this one
Apr 29 00:58:23 <SomeKittens>	kjn: I'm working in Node.js, which has VERY mutable Buffers
Apr 29 00:58:44 <bnagy>	and you'll need your xor algebra
Apr 29 00:59:14 <kjn>	yeah. i might've made for work you then. sorry. :(
Apr 29 00:59:28 <bnagy>	17 is probably my second favourite after 47/48
Apr 29 00:59:59 <kjn>	you know there's a set 7 now, bnagy?
Apr 29 01:00:14 <bnagy>	I know, but I haven't had time to do it
Apr 29 01:00:23 <bnagy>	I am really waiting for the EC set
Apr 29 01:00:39 <SomeKittens>	So are these at all helpful in the job hunt?
Apr 29 01:00:47 <bnagy>	which I actually want to do for real stuff, cause I'm nessing with EC crypto irl
Apr 29 01:01:06 <SomeKittens>	I'm meeting with some guys from Norse next week
Apr 29 01:02:09 <kjn>	i should really get around to finishing these. they're pretty interesting
Apr 29 01:02:19 <kjn>	only got through the first two sets
Apr 29 01:02:51 <bnagy>	the DSA/RSA set is eyepopping
Apr 29 01:03:08 <bnagy>	and those are full-on "you see this in the wild" attacks
Apr 29 01:03:41 <bnagy>	some guys broke a bunch of firmware stuff with the bleichenbacher cube root think just last year
Apr 29 01:03:51 <bnagy>	*thing
Apr 29 01:04:42 <bnagy>	embedded. Hacking like it's 1989.
Apr 29 01:06:00 <bnagy>	SomeKittens: if you finish all 48 without cheating and maybe nail microcorruption then I'm pretty sure someone will give you a start somewhere
Apr 29 01:06:21 <SomeKittens>	Yeah, tackling Microcorruption after these
Apr 29 01:06:31 <SomeKittens>	unless Starfighter finally releases
Apr 29 01:06:32 <bnagy>	it's certainly a lot more impressive to people that actually know what they're talking about than any cert collection
Apr 29 01:06:33 <lde>	Microcorruption is super neat
Apr 29 01:06:39 <lde>	got through all but 1
Apr 29 01:06:44 <lde>	but took me a *long* time
Apr 29 01:07:58 <kjn>	microcorruption?
Apr 29 01:08:15 <bnagy>	I think it's just microcorruption.com
Apr 29 01:08:39 <bnagy>	yar. It's a CTF based on a simple CPU
Apr 29 01:09:21 <bnagy>	exploit dev stuff
Apr 29 01:10:09 <bnagy>	crap, I need to run
Apr 29 01:10:11 <kjn>	huh
Apr 29 01:10:39 <kjn>	looks interesting. i need to check it out
Apr 29 01:10:43 <bnagy>	there is a lagoon sunset and a bunch of beers with my name of them
Apr 29 01:11:46 <lde>	kjn: yah its basically binary exploitation on a 16 bit platform
Apr 29 01:11:52 <kjn>	oooh! :)
Apr 29 01:12:00 <lde>	but i learnt a lot there
Apr 29 01:12:06 <kjn>	about the lagoon and beers, i mean. :)
Apr 29 01:12:06 <lde>	am sure you'll have fun :)
Apr 29 01:12:12 <lde>	lol
Apr 29 01:19:11 <bnagy>	SomeKittens: oh, well done, btw :)
Apr 29 01:19:19 <bnagy>	if you finish this next one you'll run the table
